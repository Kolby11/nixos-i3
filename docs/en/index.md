features:
  - title: Declarative deployment
    details: Deploy NixOS.
  - title: Multiple desktop environments
    details: Easily switch between or experiment with multiple desktop environments like Hyprland, i3, GNOME, and KDE. Each environment can be installed, configured, and maintained in isolation, giving you full control over your user experience.
  - title: Separate user configuration
    details: With Home Manager, you can manage your user environment declaratively — including dotfiles, packages, themes, and shell configurations — entirely separate from the system configuration. This keeps your setup portable, consistent, and easy to maintain across machines.
